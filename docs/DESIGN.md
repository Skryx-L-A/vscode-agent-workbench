# Design skills — and the two tools they call

Four skills in `bundle/dot-claude/skills/` cover the part of the work where an agent has to
produce something a person will *look at*: a website, a report, a proposal, a deck, a CV.

| Skill | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `design-bausteine` | The procedure between a brief and a deliverable: a four-part build prompt (aesthetic / reference / intent / guardrails), a fan-out from five directions to three variants to one, and a **capped** self-audit at the end |
| `design-critique` | The heavier review before something goes outside: two forced, isolated assessments — one reads the design, one *measures* it — and a single bounded fix round |
| `document-design` | Documents and decks: genre first, layout decisions written down, Typst / Touying / PPTX / DOCX, and no document called finished before every page has been rendered to an image and looked at |
| `design-harvest`, `framer-inspiration` | Gathering the reference material the first skill turns into a brief |

They work on their own. Two of them are stronger when a companion tool is on `PATH`:

- **`slop-detect`** — a deterministic lint over web source (Astro, HTML, JSX/TSX, Vue, Svelte,
  CSS) for the patterns that mark a generated frontend: side-tab accent borders, nested cards,
  icon-tile stacks, gradient text, numbered section labels without an order, bounce easing,
  em-dash overuse, contrast below AA. No model, no network, so it costs nothing to run on every
  change. `design-critique` uses it for the measuring half.
- **`docrender`** — renders a document (Typst source, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, ODT, ODP), rasterises
  every page, and reports what is visually wrong: margins, silent font substitution, text
  contrast, size inconsistency, orphaned headings, hyphenated headings, widow/orphan lines,
  measure in characters per line, missing folios. `document-design` calls it as its last step.

## Why they are not in this repository

Both are separate projects with their own test suites, and they do not belong in a setup
bundle — vendored here, they would drift out of sync with their own repositories within days.

**Both skills work without them, and say so explicitly rather than skipping the step:**

- `document-design` has an *"If the tool is not installed"* section: render as usual, then walk
  `reference/antipatterns.md` — its *"Running the catalogue"* section carries the manual
  `pdffonts` / `pdftotext` / `pdftohtml` commands for the mechanical half — and record in the
  report that the tool was unavailable.
- `design-critique` says the same for `slop-detect`: compute the WCAG contrast of every
  text-on-background pair by hand (opacity utilities like `text-x/60` are where the real
  failures hide), count the measure, read spacing off the render, check heading levels for gaps.

That is the honest arrangement: the skills carry the judgement, the tools only make the
mechanical half cheap. If you write your own equivalents, the skills will use them — both are
invoked by name from `PATH`, not by path.

## The finding that shaped these skills

The skills were not written from opinion. An A/B test built the same brief twice on the same
stack — once with a plain frontend-design skill, once with a well-regarded anti-slop skill
(52k stars) driving it:

- **The output was not prettier.** Both pages passed all 58 of that skill's own mechanical rules
  with zero hits. Neither looked generated.
- **Both pages shipped the same real defects** — a contact form with no email field, a phone
  number that was not a `tel:` link, no mobile navigation. Only the page that ran a *mandatory
  critique* found them. The other had them too, undetected.
- **The mechanical rule that mattered most did not fire on either page.** Both had a genuine
  contrast failure (4.24:1 and 4.44:1 against the 4.5:1 floor, caused by Tailwind opacity
  utilities). That skill's contrast rule lives only in its browser-injection path and never ran
  in the static scan.
- **The model's own critique reported invented numbers.** It gave three contrast ratios; two of
  the three were wrong. Not vague — confidently wrong.

Three rules came out of that, and they are why the skills are shaped the way they are:

1. **The value is a forced second look, not a better first draft.** Hence two isolated
   assessments in `design-critique` instead of asking one agent to check itself.
2. **Never trust a model's measurements.** Anything numeric — contrast, measure, spacing — gets
   recomputed. `slop-detect` exists because a regex is cheaper and more honest than a guess.
3. **Cap the loop.** One build, one batched inspection covering desktop and mobile together, one
   fix round, then stop. Open-ended self-QA costs money without improving the result — a single
   landing page's mandatory critique ran up roughly 178,000 extra tokens.

A fourth rule came out of building the tools: **false findings are more expensive than missing
rules.** `docrender` initially reported 49 findings per document on its own house template
style — a margin column read as a too-narrow margin, a full-bleed title page as clipped content,
two grey levels apart as a contrast failure. Four calibration rounds against real, independently
built documents brought that to zero or one. A tool nobody trusts does not get run; a tool that
finds nothing is worse than one with false positives.
